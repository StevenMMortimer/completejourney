## Overview

An R data package of the Complete Journey Study provided by
[84.51](http://www.8451.com). The data represents retail shopping
transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are
frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of each householdâ€™s
purchases, not just those from a limited number of categories. For
certain households, demographic information as well as direct marketing
contact history are included. The package comes with the following
datasets:

  - `transaction_data`: products purchased by households
  - `product`: product metadata (brand, description, etc.)
  - `hh_demographic`: household demographic data (age, income, family
    size, etc.)
  - `campaign_table`: campaigns received by each household
  - `campaign_desc`: campaign metadata (length of time active)
  - `coupon`: coupon metadata (UPC code, campaign, etc.)
  - `coupon_redempt`: coupon redemptions (household, day, UPC code,
    campaign)
  - `causal_data`: product placement in mailer and in-store
    corresponding to campaigns
